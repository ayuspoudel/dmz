# Version 1 — Architecture

This document explains the original `dotmanz` ZSH configuration system (v1.0.0), which focused on creating a clean, structured, and modular environment for `.zshrc` configurations using plain shell scripting and directory structure.

## Philosophy

The purpose of v1 was to avoid monolithic `.zshrc` files and allow developers to:

- Organize aliases, functions, and exports into isolated files
- Safely manage updates without breaking entire configs
- Preserve secrets and plugins separately
- Make shell onboarding for new team members extremely simple

---

## Folder Structure

```bash
~/Code/
├── dotfiles/         # Your main config repo
│   └── zsh/          # Modular ZSH configuration files
├── bin/              # Optional: your automation scripts
````

---

## `.zshrc` Template

The `.zshrc` file in this setup is minimal:

```zsh
ZSH_CONFIG="$HOME/Code/dotfiles/zsh"

for config_file in "$ZSH_CONFIG"/*.zsh; do
  source "$config_file"
done

[[ -f "$ZSH_CONFIG/private.zsh" ]] && source "$ZSH_CONFIG/private.zsh"
```

This loop automatically loads all `.zsh` modules in the folder and includes secrets if present.

---

## What Each File Did

### `aliases.zsh`

* Common shell shortcuts like `cls`, `czsh`, `szsh`, and project directory jumps

### `aws.zsh`

* AWS CLI profiles and helpful aliases for S3, EC2, IAM, etc.

### `docker.zsh`

* Shortcuts like `dcu`, `dcl`, `dps` for Docker/Compose workflows

### `dynatrace.zsh`

* Dynatrace-related environment variables (non-secret)

### `git.zsh`

* Git power aliases like `gpush`, `gco`, `glog`, `gundo`, etc.

### `terraform.zsh`

* `tfcleanapply`, `tfplanout`, etc. to improve Terraform dev experience

### `helpers.zsh`

* Defines functions like `a.aws`, `a.git`, etc. for discovering group aliases

### `path.zsh`

* Adds `~/Code/bin` or other utility folders to `$PATH`

### `plugins.zsh`

* Safely sources ZSH plugins (autosuggestions, completions)

### `prompt.zsh`

* Customizes prompt with folder, time, branch, etc.

### `private.zsh`

* Stores secrets (ignored by Git)

### `safety.zsh`

* Safer `rm`, improved `less`, better timestamp handling

### `automation.zsh`

* Adds `run <script>` support for executing things inside `~/Code/bin`

---

## Adding a New Module

```bash
touch ~/Code/dotfiles/zsh/k8s.zsh
```

Add aliases:

```zsh
alias kctx='kubectl config use-context'
alias kpods='kubectl get pods'
```

Reload:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

---

## Why This Mattered

This setup avoided fragile `.zshrc` clutter and made it easy to:

* Version control configs
* Move across machines
* Work in a team-friendly way
* Instantly bootstrap any shell environment
